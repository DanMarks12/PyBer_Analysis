# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
The purpose of our analysis was to explore ride sharing data of our ride service based on the type of city (Urban, Suburban, Rural). Upon merging our 2 dataframe we are able to take differnt views of each city type be it average fare, number of drivers, and eventually daily and weekly views. By creating these analysis (shown below) we are able to make important business desicions which could affect marketing to consumers as well as marketing projects to recruit new drivers in cities where we see opportunity in. Our final piece of analysis provided us with a view of total fare by city over a duration of time so we are able to measure the profitability we have experienced in the given city types. 


## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
We ran all kinds of analysis through our DataFrame to give different views on our business models in these cities. We started off with a scatter plot with all 3 city types represented to give a better comparison of each.
